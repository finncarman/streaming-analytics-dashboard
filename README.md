## Next Steps

1. Clean and validate the dataset in SQL.  
2. Build retention and churn queries by cohort and subscription type.  
3. Create KPI metrics (e.g., Average Tenure, Active Subscriptions, Churn Rate).  
4. Visualise results in Tableau Public.

## Outcome

The final deliverable will be a **Tableau Public dashboard** showing:
- Monthly cohort retention trends.  
- Subscription churn breakdown by plan type.  
- Key KPIs summarising performance over time.
