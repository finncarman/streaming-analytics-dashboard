# Streaming Subscription Analytics Dashboard

An end-to-end data analytics project exploring retention, churn, revenue growth, and lifetime value across customer cohorts for a subscription-based streaming platform.

---

## Project Overview
This project combines **SQL** data preparation and **Tableau** visualisation to uncover trends in customer behaviour, helping understand what drives retention and long-term growth.

The dataset simulates real-world subscription activity, including join dates, cancellation data, and payment details. It was cleaned, transformed, and visualised to deliver actionable insights.

---

## Objectives
- Identify customer churn and retention trends over time.  
- Analyse cohort-based revenue and lifetime value growth.  
- Evaluate customer tenure and average engagement period.  
- Build a professional analytics dashboard to visualise KPIs and trends clearly.

## Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** – Data cleaning, transformation & cohort preparation.  
- **Tableau Public** – Dashboard design & visualisation.  
- **Excel** – Exploratory review and data validation.

## SQL Workflow Summary
1. Imported the raw CSV and formatted `created_date` and `canceled_date` columns.  
2. Calculated active users per month, churned users, and retention by cohort.  
3. Derived key KPIs:
   - Churn Rate %
   - Retention Rate %
   - Average Tenure (Months)
   - Total & Cumulative Revenue
   - Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
4. Exported cleaned and aggregated tables for Tableau.
